                    <p class="article-title"><b>National Basketball Association 2024-2025 Season Preview & Awards Predictions - 09.26.2024</b></p>
                        <p class="p-article-first"><b><i>Introduction</i></b></p>
                        <p class="p-article">We're one month away from the start of the 2024-2025 National Basketball Association season and I can't say I'm that excited. Has the product become watered down, am I wrong to be stuck reminiscing about the 2000s-2010s NBA, should I be more excited to see today's stars play, that is when they aren't on a minutes restriction?</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article">Ratings seem to keep growing, along with revenues and salaries, so I'm sure the Dracula look alike, Adam Silver could give an expletive what anyone but the executives, owners, and his star players think. He’s most likely already put a plan in place to ensure he coddles the players better than the season prior, followed by a few calls to his favorite owners, looking for reassurance about his European themed in-season tournament. I get the idea. Bring some excitement to the regular season, entice some of the players to try a little harder, and ultimately attract more viewership. It makes a lot of sense. Let me one up the Commissioner with another crazy idea, eliminate or at least reduce minutes restrictions. Listen, I get the player health aspect, the decreased risk of injury, and the increased longevity of careers, but when have minutes restrictions actually ever been a part of the NBA? I’m pretty sure players have had long and successful careers far before it ever was a thing. If this is truly impossible, should they shorten the season? What about more time off during the All-Star break? It seems we are at a turning point and Silver has some decisions to make. But enough about him, I’ll let him go think about all of that before he slips into a coffin and cape for a good night's rest.</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article">One thing we can all look forward to is the last year of what might be the worst contract in the NBA (you almost won Rudy). Ben Simmons and his 40 plus million dollar contract will expire after this season and I think most of us are excited to see what unfolds next for him. Will he play over twenty five games this season? How many workout videos will he post of him making three pointers from now until the start of the season? Will another team sign him? Every NBA fan is hoping it’s not their team that does.</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article-first"><b><i>Old Faces in New Places</i></b></p>
                        <p class="p-article">Looking forward to this season, it is probably best if I mention some old faces in new places. “Not So Playoff P”, Paul George, will look to make a run with the 76ers and Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey as he looks to reclaim his “Playoff P” nickname. The “Splash Brothers” look more like step brothers whose parents couldn’t make it work, with Klay Thompson joining Luka and Kyrie in Dallas. The Chris Paul experiment in Golden State didn’t last long as he headed to San Antonio to team up with Wemby. The Villanova Wildcats, I mean the New York Knicks, added Mikal Bridges from the Brooklyn Nets where he will join former Wildcats Jalen Brunson, Donte DiVencenzo, and Josh Hart. DeMar DeRozan increased his championship aspirations from none to some, heading back to his home state of California to join the Sacramento Kings. Oklahoma City bolstered its depth and added some size with the additions of Alex Caruso and Isaiah Hartenstein. Dejounte Murrary is headed to New Orleans, Russell Westbrook to Denver, and Josh Giddey to Chicago. Insert rest of players I missed here. Great, all covered.</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article-first"><b><i>Rookie of the Year</i></b></p>
                        <p class="p-article">Before we move on to team predictions, let’s take a quick look at the individual awards, starting with Rookie of the Year. With my draft board pulled up, I’m just going to go ahead and skip over the first two picks. Nothing against the French, but I know next to nothing about Sarr (+1000) or Risacher (+900), other than they are 19 and from what I’ve heard, likely developmental projects. Going down the board a few names jump out to me. Reed Sheppard, the 6’2” shooting guard out of Kentucky can light it up from three. Unfortunately he will be playing with a lot of young players in Houston that will all be contending for shots, but if he gets his fair share, he stands a decent chance at +700 and the second lowest odds on DraftKings. Zach Edey, the 7’4” big man from Purdue, drafted 9th overall, is the odds-on favorite to win according to DraftKings at +550 and after his strong showing in college and the summer league, it makes a lot of sense. Edey should contribute right away and figures to fill up the rebounds category. He likely will be involved in a lot of pick and rolls with Ja Morant and should be the beneficiary of easy looks near the rim. I wouldn’t be surprised in the least bit if he leads all rookies in double doubles. Matas Buzelis, the 6’9” small forward and the 11th pick of the Chicago Bulls is enticing at +1000. He should be a versatile role player for the Bulls to start the season, but if they lose anyone to injury or trade (Zach Lavine, cough cough), he could step into an expanded role and has the potential to fill up the stat sheet. Jared McCain and Dalton Knecht, the 16th and 17th overall picks, will both be good NBA players and early on, should have immediate role player value for their respective teams. Unfortunately, they both are contending with too much surrounding talent to likely garner enough attention to win ROY, but at +1100 for Knecht and +3500 for McCain, they could be a decent dart throw, especially given the injury history and past minutes restrictions of the stars on their teams.</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article">While I may be biased or just wishful thinking (Bulls fan…), I’ll take Buzelis at +1000 for Rookie of the Year. If Lavine gets traded, or injuries start piling up, +1000 is going to look like a steal. The Bulls are among a group of teams with the greatest odds, all at +100000 to win the title, so it’s highly unlikely they are even playing for a play-in or playoff spot this season. This makes the case for Buzelis to have an expanded role that much greater as the Bulls look to develop their young talent.</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article-first"><b><i>Most Improved Player</i></b></p>
                        <p class="p-article">The Most Improved Player award features three big men at the lowest odds, starting with Victor Wembanyama at +750, Evan Mobley at +1000, and Jonathan Kuminga at +1400. Scottie Barnes comes in at +1600, with Josh Giddey at +1700. Jalen Williams and Cade Cunningham are both at +2000. Jonathan Kuminga could see an elevation in utilization with Klay Thompson out of Golden State and an aging Warriors roster. He showed glimpses of improvement last year and I wouldn’t be surprised if he ends up proving to be a great value pick at +1400. Another interesting pick down the list is Scoot Henderson at +2800, primarily because he just played so bad last year that even normal play could be interpreted as a large improvement. With a potentially expanded role in Chicago, as well as an uptick in shot attempts, Josh Giddey at +1700 has some legs, albeit would depend heavily on him taking those shots, as well as being a better shooter than he has shown in the past. Given Wembanyama had such a strong season last year, making it harder to win this award, I like Jonathan Kuminga at +1400. He was third on the team in points per game last year behind Curry and Klay and I expect him to be the beneficiary of a lot of the shot attempts that just walked out the door. Kuminga should average 20+ points per game on a team that screams “Play-In Tournament.”</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article-first"><b><i>Defensive Player of the Year</i></b></p>
                        <p class="p-article">Defensive Player of the Year is -180 on DraftKings for Victor Wembanyama, with Rudy Gobert next at +1100. I wouldn’t touch this with a ten foot pole, but barring injury… Victor Wembanyama.</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article-first"><b><i>6th Man of the Year</i></b></p>
                        <p class="p-article">Picking the winner of the sixth Man of the Year award before the season even starts seems like it should be a parlay in itself. One, I need to pick a winner and two, I need to pick a sixth man. Here’s the list: Malik Monk (+475), Naz Reid (+650), Caris LeVert (+1100), Donte DiVincenzo (+1200), Jordan Clarkson (+1300), Buddy Hield (+1400), and CJ McCollum (+1400). I only wrote all of those, because I was waiting to get to CJ McCollum. He’d be my pick, but I don’t think he's going to come off the bench. I’ll take Malik Monk. He was runner up last year, the Kings should be better this year, and most of all… I’m pretty confident he is a sixth man</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article-first"><b><i>Most Valuable Player</i></b></p>
                        <p class="p-article">While I won’t reveal my Finals MVP pick until the end of this article, here are the DraftKings odds for Regular Season MVP and Finals MVP.</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article">Regular Season MVP: Jokic +350, Doncic +370, SGA + 600, Embiid +600, Giannis +650, Edwards +1200, Tatum +1800, Brunson +1800, Wembanyama +2000, and Morant +3000.</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article">Finals MVP: Tatum +600, Brown +900, SGA +1000, Jokic +1000, Doncic +1200, Embiid +1300, Brunson +1300, Giannis +1600, Edwards +1800, and Curry +3500.</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article">For the Regular Season MVP, is it possible the voters will have Jokic fatigue? Having won three of the last four, who’s to say. Should they have Jokic fatigue? Definitely not. He’s basically been the embodiment of an MVP for the past four seasons, and the one season he didn’t win, well again… fatigue? I like either him or Doncic to win, and if he stays healthy and plays the full season, Giannis could give either of them a run for their money. Given the circumstances, I’ll take Doncic. He should put up monster numbers, play a lot, and his name isn’t Nikola Jokic. I’m slightly banking on that whole fatigue thing…</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article-first"><b><i>Coach of the Year</i></b></p>
                        <p class="p-article">For Coach of the Year, DraftKings has the Rockets’ Ime Udoka at +900, Celtics’ Joe Mazzulla  at +1000, Magic’s Jamahl Mosley at +1000, and the 76ers’ Nick Nurse at +1200. Tom Thibodeau and Mark Daigneault of the Knicks and Thunder are both at +1300, while Taylor Jenkings of the Grizzlies, Erik Spoelstra of the Heat, and Chris Finch of the Timberwolves are at +1400. One of the most talked about coaches of this off season, JJ Redick, of the LA Lakers is tied with one of the least talkative coaches, Greg Popovich of the Spurs at +1800.</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article">Honestly, I have next to no commentary on this and I’d be lying if I told you I didn’t look up at least half of these guys to see what teams they coach. To me this is an award for a coach who outperforms expectations and overachieves in comparison to the team’s talent, or to a coach who’s team completely dominates the rest of the league. I’ll go with the former. Give me Jamahl Mosely at +1000 and I’ll hope the Magic outperform in the east with their young core.</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article-first"><b><i>Finals Champion</i></b></p>
                        <p class="p-article">According to DraftKings, and probably almost everywhere, the Celtics are the odds-on favorite to win the NBA finals this season (+295) and it really isn’t that close. Followed by OKC (+700) and the 76ers (+850), it’s hard to imagine a world where the Cs don’t at least make the Eastern Conference Finals. Denver at +950 is tasty, but the Knicks at similar odds (+900), makes me sick. Dallas and the Timberwolves follow them up at +1000, followed by the Bucks at +1300. The odds leap after that to +3000 for the Suns and Lakers respectively, then the Warriors at +3500 with a bunch of teams I won’t mention at +4000 or longer. I can’t say I hate the Timberwolves at +1000, especially if Anthony Edwards takes another step in elevating his game, and the Bucks at +1300 is pretty tempting, especially if you believe at all in Giannis. Let’s not forget that Lillard only arrived in Milwaukee around this time last year and Doc arrived even later.</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article">With all of this in mind, let me go get my crystal ball and proceed to throw it out the window, because like most people I have no clue. I really like the Timberwolves and Bucks at the odds given. I think people are forgetting how good a healthy Giannis is and that basketball, although it may seem to be false in the current NBA, is a team sport. I like Lillard to have a better rapport with Giannis and the rest of the team, along with Doc Rivers. I see the Bucks playing with a lot less “your turn, my turn”, between Dame and Giannis, and with a lot better flow and ball movement than last year. Maybe even Khris Middleton will stay healthy along with the rest of the supporting cast.</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article">I’ll take the Bucks as a dark horse NBA Finals Champion this year, winning the ship over the Minnesota Timberwolves. Give me the Celtics to make the Eastern Conference Finals, along with the Nuggets to make the Western Conference Finals. If the Bucks are going to win it all, my assumption is Giannis Antetokounmpo will be the biggest reason why and at +1600, he is my Finals MVP pick.</p><br>
                        <p class="p-article">Thank you for reading and enjoy the 2024-2025 NBA season.</p><br>
